      <p>My name is <b class="color--primary">Aidan</b> (eye-den) - Gaelic name with a German pronunciation. Thanks, mom! I am: 30 years old; married to an amazing woman; a father of 3 boys; an avid dreamer and tinkerer;  currently the Director of Engineering at IdealSpot Inc.</p>
      <p>Challenging problems excite me, and with nearly a decade of experience in Software Engineering Leadership, Iâ€™ve tackled them from many angles: rapid prototyping, architecting and delivering go-to-market products, building high quality engineering teams, and managing engineering operations and security. I'm both highly creative and highly analytical - an artist with a Systems & Industrial Engineering Degree. It makes me a natural problem solver - asking the right questions, discovering the core problems, dreaming up innovative solutions, analyzing them to find the best one, and deploying products on time and on budget. When surrounded by other intelligent and ambitious people, I come alive and turn good ideas into great products and experiences.</p>

          <p><b>Director of Engineering</b> | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.idealspot.com">IdealSpot Inc.</a> in Austin, TX</p>
          <p><i>October 2015 - Present</i></p>
          <p>When I started at IdealSpot, it was a bootstrapped startup with a bare-bones prototype for a commercial real estate site selection platform. I designed, architected, built, and launched the first go-to-market product in May of 2016. Then, based on user feedback and industry analysis, I did it all again for Version 2 of the platform in August of 2017 after hiring a small, first-class engineering team. In additional to complete ownership of the web platform (design, architecture, sprint planning, engineering management, QA, and CI/CD), I handle operational security for the organization, and SalesOps.</p>

          <p><i>March 2014 - October 2015</i></p>
          <p>As a part of a team of only 3 engineers, I developed a full internet banking web app from the ground up in less than a year. The product was built using Node.js, React.js, and LESS, and it interfaced with a central Web Services Platform that also services iOS and Android applications. The platform was acquired by Finastra in 2018.</p>

          <p>My two partners and I created an outsourced software development business with a network of over 100 vendors. We delivered over 30 high-quality web-apps and websites and built our own SaaS solution for vendor management using PHP.</p>
