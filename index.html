        <p>My name is <b class="color--primary">Aidan</b> (eye-den) - Gaelic name with a German pronunciation. Thanks, mom! I am: 30 years old; married to an amazing woman; a father of 3 boys; an avid dreamer and tinkerer;  currently the Director of Engineering at IdealSpot Inc.</p>
        <p>Challenging problems excite me, and in nearly a decade of experience in Software Engineering Leadership, Iâ€™ve tackled them from many angles: rapid prototyping, architecting and delivering go-to-market products, building high quality engineering teams, and managing engineering operations and security. I'm both highly creative and highly analytical - an artist with a Systems & Industrial Engineering Degree. It makes me a natural problem solver - asking the right questions, discovering the core problems, dreaming up innovative solutions, analyzing them to find the best one, and deploying products on time and on budget. When surrounded by other intelligent and ambitious people, I come alive and turn good ideas into great products and experiences.</p>

              <p class="quote">I have never seen someone be able to look at the whole stack and dissect with ease how a system should be organized. Aidan is thorough in his designs and communicates them with ease. He is open to feedback and leverages the strength of the team to create phenomenal products. Aidan is not afraid to get his hands dirty in the code and when he encounters a complex problem he executes the solutions with determination.</p>

              <p class="quote">He's smart and he enjoys finding interesting and creative solutions to complex problems. It seems like whatever problem I throw at him, he knows precisely what to do to solve it and he works closely with his team to ensure all work is completed on time and on budget.</p>

              <p class="quote">Aidan is by far the best manager I have worked for because he knows how to keep the engineering team on time but still balance the human element of managing a company. He is always willing to listen and push his engineers so that they can achieve their goals.</p>
