A simple, front-end only portfolio site for me.

View it live at [https://aidangarza.github.com/portfolio](https://aidangarza.github.com/portfolio)

## Fun Facts
Here are a few of the fun features in this little site:

* Source code written using Stylus CSS preprocessor and ES6 JavaScript, compiled using Gulp.
* Minimal thrid party code:
    * HighCharts.js for the Skills Wordcloud
    * Normalize.css for my sanity
    * Icon Font generated on Icomoon.io
* The menu in the top-right corner is controlled with CSS, no JavaScript.
* The section labels after my name in the header are controlled with IntersectionObserver instances on each section.
* The cool slant effect in the experience section was acheived by skewing the whole section, and then unskewing each paragraph.
* The cool responsive hexagon grid is also CSS only, slightly modified from a tutorial by [Codin on Codesmite](https://www.codesmite.com/article/how-to-create-pure-css-hexagonal-grids)
